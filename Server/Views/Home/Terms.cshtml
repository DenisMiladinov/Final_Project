        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Welcome to ExploreEden. By accessing or using our website and services,
            you agree to be bound by these Terms &amp; Conditions and our Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <h3>Bookings</h3>
        <p>
            All bookings are subject to availability. When you complete a reservation
            through our platform, a contract is formed directly between you and the
            accommodation provider. You agree to pay all charges associated with your booking.
        </p>

        <h3>Payments &amp; Fees</h3>
        <p>
            We use Stripe to process payments. You must provide valid payment information
            at the time of booking. Any service fees, taxes, or additional charges imposed
            by the provider will be displayed prior to confirmation.
        </p>

        <h3>Cancellations &amp; Refunds</h3>
        <p>
            Cancellation policies vary by property. Please review the specific cancellation
            terms on your booking confirmation. Refunds, if applicable, will be processed
            according to those terms; service fees may be non–refundable.
        </p>

        <h3>User Accounts</h3>
        <p>
            You must register and log in to manage your bookings. Keep your credentials secure.
            You are responsible for all activity on your account.
        </p>

        <h3>Reviews &amp; Conduct</h3>
        <p>
            We encourage honest reviews of your experience. Abusive, defamatory, or
            fraudulent content is strictly prohibited. We reserve the right to remove any
            reviews that violate these Terms.
        </p>

        <h3>Intellectual Property</h3>

            All content on this site, including text, graphics, logos, and images, is owned
            by ExploreEden or its licensors and is protected by copyright and trademark laws.

        <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
        <p>
            ExploreEden acts as an intermediary only. We are not responsible for the acts
            or omissions of accommodation providers. To the fullest extent permitted by law,
            our liability is limited to the amount you paid in service fees.
        </p>

        <h3>Governing Law</h3>
        <p>
            These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
            the jurisdiction in which ExploreEden is registered, without regard to conflict
            of law principles.
        </p>

        <h3>Changes to Terms</h3>
        <p>
            We may update these Terms from time to time. The “Last Updated” date at the top
            of this page indicates when changes were made. Continued use of the site after
            modifications constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.
